Send ToDo list messages locally instead of to everyone in multiplayer




This update brought to you by Robb#6731

## Changed Stuff

- All messages created by 'Add to To Do List' are now sent locally instead of to everyone in multiplayer
- Updated the display text of the placeholder ToDo list recipe to clarify that you must manually clear it when done
- Display messages in chat locally when a multiplayer client tries to use a debugging option stating that they don't work
- Renamed Mod Modules to follow new SML suggested format (no change to users)
