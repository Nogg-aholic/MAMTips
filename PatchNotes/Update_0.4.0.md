Bugfixes, add node cost to To-Do list, and lots of new customization options! See videos below. This update brought to you by Robb#6731




## New Stuff

- Add Node cost directly to your To-Do list from the MAM (WIP)
  - Use in tandem with the [PowerSuit Logistic Modules](https://ficsit.app/mod/AEr7ASfJHWpnhL) mod to seamlessly request items from storage for your research!

  - Now it's easy to see what nodes you previously purchased
  - Much more stylish and useful options than the standard "gray circle" and "gray box" that vanilla has
