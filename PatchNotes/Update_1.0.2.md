Fixed issue with a tooltip preventing clicking on nodes, and the Start Research button state becoming out of sync with the selected node




This update brought to you by Robb#6731

## Bugfixes

- The node hover tooltip now only moves to the left side of the cursor when your cursor is more than 75% of the way across the screen - this avoids the issue where nodes on the right have could be covered by the 'ghost' of the tooltip that used to be on the right side.
- Node Info panel's "Start Research" button can no longer become out of sync with the node state or get overlapping Start Research/Can't Afford text when viewing different combinations of affordable/unaffordable nodes in specific orders.
- Thanks Poogasthe13th for reporting both of these!
