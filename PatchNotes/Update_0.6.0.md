Supports both U5 and U6. New 'reopen last selected tree.' New debugging capabilities for devs.




This update brought to you by Robb#6731

## New Stuff

- **Re-open the the same Tree you viewed last time** you had the MAM open
  - This is on by default, but can be turned off in the mod config.
  - Thanks SifVerT for the idea to add this
- Lots of **debugging features for mod developers,** or cheats if you want to use them as that
  - For normal users of the mod, this should have no effect
  - Enable the off-by-default 'Debugging Features' config option to reveal buttons with the following functions
    - Grant/revoke access to viewing a tree (to test what the tree's name, icon, and description appear as)
    - Grant/revoke specific nodes in the tree directly from inside the MAM
      - The button appears in the node details, so to do this for hidden nodes, enable the 'Reveal Details of Hidden Nodes' config option
      - When revoking, it will revoke recipes unlocked by the node, but it can't undo things like hand slots or other schematics (ex. AWESOME Shop) made available by the node
    - Grant/revoke access to every node in a tree at once
    - Reset the mod's internal tutorial
