Bugfixes. Support for Info Only Unlock description viewing.




This update brought to you by Robb#6731

## New Stuff

- Added support for viewing additional information about "Info Only Unlocks" in the MAM
  - Hovering over them will pop up a tooltip that displays their description text
  - The base game uses these in the HUB, but if used in the MAM, you normally can't see their description.

## Bugfixes

- Fixed that the in-MAM config widget could not be interacted with
- Fixed that the "Debug copy asset path" button would accidentally appear in the MAM even without debugging options enabled
