## New Stuff

- Enhanced "Add to To Do List" functionality
  - Actually working again
  - Thanks SirDigby for the help troubleshooting this
  - Entries now actually state the node they came from, and you can increase/decrease their quantity
  - The entries are no longer wiped when anything else so much as breathes on the To Do list
  - Entries are still client side only in multiplayer
  - Entries still do not persist if you re-launch your game

- MAM Enhancer Invades the HUB!
  - The HUB will now display a small icon in the corner of Milestones to indicate **what mod added the Milestone**. The icon's tooltip states the mod's name.

  - Off by default for base-game Milestones.
  - I might move this functionality out to [TFIT](https://ficsit.app/mod/TFIT) later.
- **Debugging Features** have been extended to allow granting/revoking specific Milestones
