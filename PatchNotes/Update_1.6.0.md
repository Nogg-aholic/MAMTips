Shrink the "See info panel to the right" message and allow the user to hide it via mod config options.




This update brought to you by Robb.
If you enjoy my work, please consider my [completely optional tip jar](https://ko-fi.com/robb4).

## New Stuff

- Make the "see info panel" message that appears when hovering a node thinner so it doesn't cover stuff to the sides. If you click the checkbox within it, it will never show up again (unless you adjust this in the mod configs).
  - Thanks JamieRCHI for the suggestion!
