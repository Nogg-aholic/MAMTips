## New Stuff

- **Re-open the the same HUB Milestone you viewed** last time you had the HUB open
  - This is on by default, but can be turned off in the mod config.
- "Add to To Do list" functionality added to the HUB
  - Use in tandem with the [PowerSuit Logistic Modules](https://ficsit.app/mod/AEr7ASfJHWpnhL) mod to seamlessly request items from storage for your research!

## Changed Stuff

- "Hub Tweaks" config category renamed to "HUB and AWESOME Shop Tweaks"
- Placeholder To-do list item renamed to reflect the fact that both the MAM and Hub offer this feature

## Debugging Features

- Debug Mode is now also available as a Mod Savegame Setting instead of a global config option
  - ![Debug Mode Mod Savegame Setting](https://i.imgur.com/olH0tfM.png)
  - The config option will eventually be removed. If either of them are on, debug mode is enabled.
- A new node info button in the MAM allows copying the asset path of your selected **node**
- A new top bar button in the MAM allows copying the asset path of your currently viewed **tree**
- Clicking the "This Milestone Added By" icons will copy their asset path to the clipboard. They now display the asset path in their tooltip message when debug mode is enabled.
- Click a button to grant/revoke shop purchases. It will warn you if the purchase appears to be repeatable (unlocking it this way probably won't do anything then)
