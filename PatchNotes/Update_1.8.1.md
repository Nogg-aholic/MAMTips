Prevented crash when hovering the config preview widget on the main menu.

## Fixed Stuff

- Prevented viewing the tooltip of MAM nodes in the config preview widget on the main menu, as that crashes with the new SML3.11 hooking system

## Known Bugs

- The to-do list button on the MAM's right side panel does not know if the node is already on the to-do list or not, meaning it will let you add the node multiple times
