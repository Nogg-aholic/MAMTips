You can now configure if you see the large mod icon image when hovering over a tree in the list.




This update brought to you by Robb#6731

## New Stuff

- New config option: "Show Mod Icon when Hovering Tree Listing"
  - Show a larger version of the logo icon of the mod that added a Research Tree when hovering over it in the list.
  - On by default (behavior unchanged from past versions of the mod)
  - Thanks Feyko for the suggestion!

## Changed Stuff

- The "Added by" text in the Research Tree hover is now orange instead of blue to match with the game's color scheme.
  - Thanks MrHid for bringing this to my attention!
